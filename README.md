# Prophet Forecasting for Portfolio Optimisation

An end-to-end machine learning project that forecasts stock and asset prices using LightGBM (Gradient Boosting) models, then applies Markowitz portfolio optimisation to rebalance portfolios based on these forecasts.

## Project Overview

This project combines machine learning-based time series forecasting with modern portfolio theory to create an automated trading and portfolio management system. The workflow consists of two main components:

1. **LightGBM Price Forecasting**: Uses gradient boosting to predict future asset prices
2. **Markowitz Portfolio Optimisation**: Optimises portfolio allocation based on forecasted returns and risk

## Components

### 1. LightGBM (Gradient Boosting Machine)

**What is LightGBM?**

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It's designed to be distributed and efficient, with faster training speed and lower memory usage compared to traditional gradient boosting methods.

**Why LightGBM for Stock Prediction?**

LightGBM is excellent for tabular time series data because it:
- Handles non-linear patterns in price movements effectively
- Works well with lagged features and historical data
- Trains faster than deep learning models like LSTM
- Provides feature importance insights
- Requires minimal feature engineering compared to neural networks

**How It Works in This Project:**

- Input: Historical price data with lagged prices, moving averages, and returns
- Architecture: Gradient boosting trees that learn patterns from historical features
- Output: Forecasted prices for each asset in the portfolio for the next time period
- Training: The model learns from historical data to minimize prediction error

### 2. Markowitz Portfolio Optimisation

**What is Markowitz Portfolio Optimisation?**

Markowitz portfolio optimisation, also known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), is a mathematical framework for constructing optimal portfolios. Developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, it balances the trade-off between expected returns and risk.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Expected Return**: The weighted average of expected returns of individual assets
- **Risk (Volatility)**: Measured as the standard deviation of portfolio returns
- **Correlation**: How assets move relative to each other
- **Efficient Frontier**: The set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk

**The Optimisation Problem:**

The Markowitz model solves:

```
Maximize: μᵀw - λ(wᵀΣw)

Subject to:
- Σwᵢ = 1 (weights sum to 1)
- wᵢ ≥ 0 (long-only portfolio, optional)
- Additional constraints (sector limits, etc.)
```

Where:
- `μ` = vector of expected returns (from LightGBM price forecasts)
- `Σ` = covariance matrix of asset returns
- `w` = portfolio weights
- `λ` = risk aversion parameter

**How It Works in This Project:**

1. **Input**: Forecasted returns (derived from LightGBM price predictions) for each asset
2. **Risk Estimation**: Historical covariance matrix calculated from asset returns
3. **Optimisation**: Solves for optimal weights that maximise risk-adjusted returns
4. **Output**: Recommended portfolio allocation (weights for each asset)
5. **Rebalancing**: Portfolio is rebalanced based on these optimal weights

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies using Poetry
make install

# Or manually
poetry install
```

### Installation on M-chip Mac (Apple Silicon)

If you're using an M-chip Mac (Apple Silicon), you'll need to install additional dependencies for LightGBM:

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
# /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install pyenv and libomp
brew install pyenv
brew install libomp

# Then proceed with standard installation
make install
# or
poetry install
```

**Note**: `libomp` (OpenMP library) is required for LightGBM to compile correctly on Apple Silicon Macs.
